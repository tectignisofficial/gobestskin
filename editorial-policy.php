                <h1>Gobest Skin & Hair’s Editorial Policy</h1>
                <p>Defining Gobest Skin & Hair’s editorial policy for blogs helps us set quality benchmarks at par with the industry
                    standards and establish processes to ensure accuracy, utility, inclusivity and objectivity across
                    all our content.</p>
                <h4>Our Quality guidelines:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Prioritising readers:</strong> We try our best to map our blog content around common
                        reader queries and doubts. Our articles help decipher complicated medical jargon and analyse the
                        potential solutions to help you overcome any paranoia or misconception. We believe in sharing
                        the pros and cons of various treatment options available in India with our readers through our
                        blogs. We guide them to prioritise their skin and hair health and overall wellbeing while trying
                        to lose weight.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accuracy &amp; Reliability:</strong> Our subject matter experts do extensive research
                        and collate facts from reputed scientific journals and international clinical studies to provide
                        optimal and objective information and create awareness through our blogs. Factual accuracy
                        remains paramount for us, and that is why our medical review board and expert panel diligently
                        review all our articles. Besides that, our qualified dermatologists, certified nutritionists and
                        professional fitness trainers add exclusive tips and advice in our articles based on their rich
                        academic knowledge, vast clinical experience and critical industry insights to recommend
                        evidence-backed treatment options for your optimal safety and satisfaction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inclusivity &amp; Sensitivity:</strong> We create blog articles on dermatology concerns
                        and treatment options, fat loss, nutrition, exercise and weight loss related topics for Indian
                        readers. So all treatment options and technical or pricing-related information included in our
                        blogs are relevant to the local audience and domestic market only but may not necessarily apply
                        to Gobest Skin & Hair Skin &amp; Hair Clinic. Our blog content is informative, our intent is creating
                        awareness, our tone is respectful, and our style is conversational and engaging. At Gobest Skin & Hair, we
                        strongly condemn any form of bias based on body shaming and are strictly against using any
                        derogatory terminology associated with it. We want all our readers, irrespective of their age,
                        colour, gender, region, religion, caste, body shape and type, and concern, to gain knowledge and
                        make informed decisions to enjoy healthy skin, hair and body.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Editorial Integrity</h2>
                <p>The content on our blogs is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or
                    treatment, and readers must exercise their discretion before following our recommendations. We
                    strongly advise a consultation with a qualified dermatologist, certified nutritionist and a
                    professional fitness instructor before changing your hair and skin-care regimen, dietary habits and
                    exercise routine.</p>
                <p>The costs mentioned on our blogs reflect the general market trends and are subject to revision. These
                    price ranges are for reference purposes only and do not apply to clinical treatments at Gobest Skin & Hair Skin
                    &amp; Hair Clinic. Since Gobest Skin & Hair specialises in customised treatments, we recommend you visit our
                    clinic to find more details about a suitable treatment plan and its exact cost.</p>
                <p><strong>Treatment/Product recommendations and listings:</strong> Our blogs may include all the weight
                    loss and dermatology treatment options available in India. However, our experts recommend
                    scientifically-backed skin and hair treatments only with proven safety and efficacy for Indians. We
                    also advocate healthy weight loss, focusing on reducing harmful body fat for long-lasting health
                    benefits. Our blogs may discuss home remedies/OTC products/crash diets/weight loss
                    pills/massages/salon services/facials/slimming belts that promise overnight results, but our experts
                    always advise exercising caution while experimenting with them as their results are subjective while
                    the risk of complications involved is high.<br>
                    We suggest products approved by dermatologists only and avoid promoting any specific brand.</p>
