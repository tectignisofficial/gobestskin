                                        <p>Skin ageing is a universal concern. However, poor lifestyle habits and
                                            high-stress levels can cause premature skin ageing in men and women. Most of
                                            us opt for expensive creams and facials to reduce our skin creases. However,
                                            the results are dissatisfactory and short-lived. Gobest Skin & Hair Skin

                                            <h5>What Is Botox Treatment?</h5>
                                            <p>Botox is a brand name for botulinum toxin, an extract obtained by
                                                fermentation of a bacterium called <em>Clostridium botulinum</em> found
                                                in the soil. This advanced minimally-invasive skin treatment performed
                                                by expert dermatologists involves injecting this extract into the target
                                                area to reduce the appearance of facial creases, fine lines and
                                                wrinkles.</p>
                                            <p>Botox works by reducing the chemical signals from the nervous system to
                                                the target area, thereby decreasing the contractions of facial muscles
                                                and relaxing them. This ultimately reduces the visible signs of ageing
                                                by softening the overlying skin.</p>
                                            <p>A word of caution, you should undergo Botox treatment at a reputed skin
                                                clinic only when performed by a qualified dermatologist who is an expert
                                                at using it correctly in small quantities for the best anti-ageing
                                                results to avoid complications.</p>
