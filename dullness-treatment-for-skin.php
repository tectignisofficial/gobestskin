                                            <h5>Why Your Skin Looks Dull, Tired & Lifeless?</h5>
                                            <p>Your skin usually begins to show signs of dullness with age, but when it
                                                shows early-on in life, there are a number of stimulants causing it.
                                                These include lack of adequate moisture on your skin, unhealthy diet,
                                                stress, hormonal changes, cosmetic products, smoking, alcohol, exposure
                                                to sun and lack of sleep. Thus it is very important to maintain a
                                                perfect skin care routine comprising exfoliating, cleansing,
                                                moisturizing and toning. Also it is important to pay attention to the
                                                early signs of dullness and prevent or treat these symptoms in-time,
                                                else they may cause long term impact on your skin.</p>

                                            <p>The glow and radiance of your skin adds up to your personality and it
                                                reflects through your lifestyle choices, skin care regimen, diet and
                                                nutrition. The more you pay attention to these factors, more charm and
                                                youthfulness it adds to your skin. Physiological processes make our skin
                                                continue to shed old dead cells and replenish with new rejuvenated ones,
                                                and this adds up to a healthy and nourished skin. But any disturbance in
                                                the above mentioned process can make your face begin to appear dull,
                                                which becomes displeasing and embarrassing. This skin condition is
                                                common in both men and women across age groups. Facial dullness can be
                                                due to multiple factors within and outside the body. And some of them
                                                may be beyond your control. Signs of dullness are especially more
                                                prominent on forehead, neck, cheeks, chin, eyes and also lips, ear and
                                                your hairline. And without expert care, it may be challenging to combat
                                                these signs which take away your skin’s natural glow and radiance.

                                                any further tests to ascertain. But underlying build-up of dead skin
                                                that clogs the pores may be difficult to see in the beginning. So look

                                                details. Then you would proceed for initial consultation with our expert
                                                dermatologist. This a one to one consultation for around 30-45 minutes
                                                where each and every detail related to your skin and health condition is

                                            <p><strong>Step 3: Setting Up The Realistic Treatment Goal –</strong>The
                                                next step is to determine a holistic treatment plan which aims to treat
                                                the underlying root cause, along with aesthetic enhancement through
                                                specific treatments. As it is not possible to get rid of dull skin
                                                overnight thus a realistic plan is set-up in place. This is customized
                                                for every client.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Step 4: Procedural Advice –</strong> The dermatologist would then
                                                explain the details of treatment/s, medications, tests, etc. based on
                                                the evaluation of the skin. Complete details of process, sessions, cost,
                                                prescription, etc. are chalked out and this aligns the expectation of
                                                the patient in terms how to proceed further, to reach desired levels of
                                                efficacy of the treatment so chosen.</p>
