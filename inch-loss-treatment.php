                                            belly fat removal seems next to impossible! It is equally challenging to
                                            lose inches from the arm, waistline and thigh or get rid of lower back fat
                                            and armpit bulge. In short, getting rid of lower body fat is a concern that
                                            plagues most of us! . Read on to know more

                                            <p>A high body fat percentage poses a significant health risk, yet it often
                                                goes undetected due to the following reasons:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Most of us focus on losing kilos and attaining the ideal BMI (Body
                                                    Mass Index). However, what we may forget to factor in is our body
                                                    fat percentage. Metabolic obesity is a critical indicator of
                                                    unhealthy visceral fat. According to WHO, a ratio of waist and hip
                                                    circumference or WHR of .9 in men and .85 in women is a predictor of
                                                    heart diseases, brain stroke and Type 2 diabetes.</li>
                                                <li>A simplistic fitness regimen that includes diet control and workouts
                                                    fails to reduce the stubborn fat deposits. Getting back into shape
                                                    is more challenging for people who have hormonal issues, genetic
                                                    propensity, insulin resistance, and metabolic diseases such as
                                                    diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and heart-related illnesses than it

                                                <li>The significance of Body Composition Analysis (BCA) remains an
                                                    unheard topic even among health-conscious people. We lack awareness
                                                    about the different types of fats and the specialised treatments
                                                    available for each. Your belly fat problem may be due to both excess
                                                    subcutaneous fat, found directly under the skin, and visceral fat

                                            maintaining a healthy waist size and ideal waist-to-hip ratio. Abdominal
                                            obesity due to excess fat accumulation around your waist increases your risk

                                            following a healthy diet and a workout routine can help you prevent
                                            lifestyle diseases and remain in shape even after the treatment is over.</p>
