                                        <p>Melasma is a pigmentation disorder that affects the skin’s tone and
                                            appearance and may lead to premature ageing in adult women. It is a benign
                                            skin disease, but its chronicity and persistence can often make it
                                            challenging to treat.</p>
                                        <p>However, experienced dermatologists at Gobest Skin & Hair excel in treating different

                                            <h5>What Is Melasma?</h5>
                                            <p>Melasma is a skin disease that leads to the appearance of flat brownish
                                                or blue-grey patches on the skin, especially on the face. It affects
                                                adults and is a more common complaint among women than men. Chloasma, or
                                                mask of pregnancy, is another name for melasma. Sun exposure is a common
                                                risk factor. Melasma is a chronic pigmentary disorder that waxes and
                                                wanes but often remains resistant to treatment.</p>

                                            <h5>Where Does Melasma Commonly Occur?</h5>
                                            <p>Melasma occurs most commonly on the face, including:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Cheeks</li>
                                                <li>Forehead</li>
                                                <li>Bridge of nose</li>
                                                <li>Chin</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>Apart from the face, it rarely involves the exposed skin of the forearms,
                                                neck and back.</p>

                                            <h5>What Are The Types Of Melasma?</h5>
                                            <p>Dermatologists categorise the types of melasma based on the depth of the
                                                skin discolouration:
                                            </p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Epidermal Melasma: </strong>The melanin deposit in the
                                                    topmost layer of skin, i.e., the epidermis, leads to dark brown
                                                    patches with well-defined borders. This superficial type of melasma
                                                    responds best to treatment.
                                                </li>
                                                <li><strong>Dermal Melasma: </strong>The pigment build-up in the dermis,
                                                    the deeper layer of skin, is not easily accessible. It leads to the
                                                    appearance of light brown or bluish-grey diffused patches that
                                                    respond poorly to treatment.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Mixed Melasma: </strong>This pigmentary concern causes
                                                    different colour patches in the epidermis and dermis. This is the
                                                    most common type of melasma, and the treatment response usually
                                                    varies depending on the amount and location of the melanin build-up.
                                                </li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </div>
                                        <div>
                                            <h5>Signs And Symptoms Of Melasma</h5>
                                            <p>The signs and symptoms of melasma include:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Freckle-like spots</li>
                                                <li>Flat patches of brown, blue or grey colour</li>
                                                <li>Defined or diffused patches</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>The patches usually occur symmetrically on the cheeks, forehead, nose,
                                                chin and jawline.</p>
                                        </div>
                                        <div>
                                            <h5>What Causes Melasma?</h5>
                                            <p>Here are two primary causes of melasma:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Sun/UV Exposure: </strong>Exposure to UV radiation from the
                                                    sun or laptop/TV screens can trigger excess melanin production in
                                                    the skin. It can worsen melasma if present or cause recurrence after
                                                    treatment.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Hormonal Imbalances:</strong>Dermatologists often correlate
                                                    melasma cases with estrogen and progesterone sensitivity. Melasma is
                                                    significantly more common in pregnant women and those using
                                                    high-dose hormonal contraceptive pills. Hormonal changes during
                                                    menopause or conditions like hypothyroidism can often cause or
                                                    worsen melasma.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>Apart from these, a few other factors may trigger melasma:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Family History: </strong>Those with a positive history of
                                                    melasma in the family have a higher risk than others.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Skin Colour:</strong>People with dark skin are more likely
                                                    to develop melasma than those who are fairer.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Chemical-based Skin Care Products: </strong> Skin-care
                                                    products with fragrances and chemicals that cause skin irritation
                                                    can trigger melasma.</li>

                                            </ul>
                                        </div>

                                            <h5>How To Diagnose Melasma?</h5>
                                            <p>Dermatologists at Gobest Skin & Hair diagnose melasma by clinically examining the
                                                discoloured skin.</p>
                                            <p>They may use Wood’s lamp method to observe the skin under blue light to
                                                identify the pigmentation level. In exceptional cases, they may perform
                                                a biopsy in the affected area to confirm the diagnosis under a

                                            <p>Although many advanced treatments are available, the response of melasma
                                                to treatments remains variable. No single treatment option can ensure
                                                total and permanent relief from melasma.</p>
                                            <p>At Gobest Skin & Hair, your doctor will customise your treatment and recommend regular
                                                maintenance to reduce melasma and prevent a recurrence. She may
                                                recommend any of the following options as standalone or combo treatment
                                                based on the type, cause and severity of your skin condition:</p>

                                                    an essential part of post-care. It may include:

                                                            Vitamin C can reduce melanin synthesis and help lighten the

                                                            may need multiple sessions of chemical peel treatment at
